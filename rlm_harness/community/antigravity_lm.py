"""Run rlm-harness on a Google Antigravity sign-in through the `agy` CLI.

`AntigravityLM` is a `dspy.LM` whose completions run through `agy`, the Antigravity CLI, on the
account you signed it in with. It is a community route (`rlm_harness/community/README.md` says
what Google has and has not said about this use, and when that was read): exported from
`rlm_harness.community` only, outside the kit's SemVer promise, and it logs one warning per
process when built, because Google has not explicitly allowed this use. It goes in through the
same public seam as `ClaudeAgentLM`, `configure(main_lm=..., sub_lm=...)`, or through
`configure()`'s routing of an `"agy/<model id>"` model string by its `community.ROUTES` entry,
and it is built the same way: an ENGINE (`complete(Request) -> Response`, passed as
`dspy.LM(engine=...)`), never a `forward()` subclass, because dspy 3.4 deprecated that interface
and schedules its removal for 3.5.

Each LM call is one `agy` process in print mode, with no tools and none of the user's settings:

    agy --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json --disable-slash-commands \\
        --agent <generated> --model <id> [--json-schema <file>]

**What every choice below rests on was MEASURED against `agy` 1.4.12 on 2026-11-03**, signed in
with a personal Google account, and each is an executable-but-not-from-here claim in the
`docs/VERIFY.md` sense: it needs a signed-in `agy`, which CI does not have. The probes are
described with each claim so the next version can be checked the same way.

- **A pure completion is a generated custom agent, not a flag.** `agy` has no option that removes
  its tools or its system prompt. A custom agent in `<cwd>/.agents/agents/<name>.md` with
  `excludeDefaultComponents: true` and `tools: []` does all three things this adapter needs, each
  measured against a control: the model can read no file (asked to read a file in its cwd it
  answered that it had no tool, where the default agent read it), the user's global rules
  (`~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`) and the workspace's (`AGENTS.md`) stay out (the default agent obeyed
  both; this one obeyed neither), and the agent's Markdown body BECOMES the system prompt (a body
  of "answer BANANA" was obeyed over the user's message). A trivial prompt cost 382 input tokens
  this way against 6,900 on the default agent.
- **Structured output needs the `finish` tool, and only that.** `--json-schema` is enforced
  through a tool named `finish`. With `tools: []` the flag is SILENTLY ignored: the run reports
  `SUCCESS` after four turns of prose with no `structured_output` at all. With `tools: [finish]`
  it validates against the schema (a pydantic-style one with `$defs`, `$ref` and
  `additionalProperties: false` included), retries in the same call when validation fails, and
  returns the validated object as `structured_output`. A schema call therefore gets
  `tools: [finish]` and a plain one gets `tools: []`.
- **The answer to a structured call is `structured_output`, never `response`.** `response` JOINS
  the text of every attempt in the call, the prose and each rejected JSON included, so on a call
  where validation retried it is several documents concatenated.
- **The prompt goes on stdin, never in argv.** Linux refuses a single argument longer than
  131,072 bytes (`E2BIG`, measured at 131,073), and an RLM planner prompt can exceed that. A
  144,610-byte prompt sent as a stream-json user event arrived whole: the model answered with a
  word stated only on its last line.
- **Failure is `status != "SUCCESS"`, a `finished_reason`, or a non-zero exit.** A bad model id
  exits 1 with `status: "ERROR"` and an `error` string naming the models the account can use.
  `finished_reason` is set only when a turn ended early (`print_timeout`, `interrupted`,
  `error`), per `agy changelog`, which also documents exit code 3 and an `AGY_ERROR: {...}` stderr
  line for a model or quota failure. That last path was not reproduced here; the adapter needs
  nothing from it beyond the exit code and keeps stderr's tail in its error message.
- **Two environment variables are documented to move a call off the sign-in.** Google's install
  page (https://antigravity.google/docs/install/) documents `GEMINI_API_KEY`, which bills an API
  key once `settings.json` sets `modelProvider: "gemini"` and "on its own has no effect", and
  `AGY_ADC_AUTH=true`, which signs in with Application Default Credentials and bills a Google
  Cloud project. The binary also contains `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI`,
  `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_ENTERPRISE`, `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` and `GOOGLE_VERTEX_BASE_URL`. Each was
  set ALONE to a bogus value on a signed-in `agy` 1.5.0 on 2026-11-11 (a bogus `GEMINI_API_KEY`
  alone too), and every one of those calls still answered normally; the same page says
  `GOOGLE_API_KEY` "has no effect". That rules out each one acting by itself on this path. It
  does not rule out a combination, such as a Vertex switch together with a project and ADC, which
  was not tried; `GEMINI_API_KEY` is itself a variable that only acts in combination.

Settle any of these again with a signed-in `agy` from an empty directory:
`agy --output-format json --agent <name> --model <id> -p "..."`, with the agent file above
(prefix a variable, e.g. `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=true agy ...`, for the environment probe).

**Things this adapter does NOT control**, stated so nobody assumes otherwise:

- **Every call is saved as an Antigravity conversation**, under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli`
  (`conversations/<id>.db` and `brain/<id>/`). Measured: about 400 KB per call, prompt included,
  so a run of fifty calls leaves roughly 20 MB of transcripts holding whatever the task read.
  `agy` has no option to skip that, and this adapter does not delete another program's private
  state. The conversation id is the response id, so a call can be found again.
- **`agy` retries on its own.** Its changelog says it waits out a server-requested delay up to
  30s and stops at once on a daily or billing cap. So this adapter adds no retry rung of its own,
  where `ClaudeAgentLM` adds one.
- **Sampling controls do not exist here.** `agy` takes none, so `temperature`, `top_p` and
  `max_tokens` are tolerated and ignored. `n` is not ignored: see the class docstring.
- **AI credits past the plan's quota.** `agy`'s `useG1Credits` setting "uses your AI credits for
  model requests after your plan's quota runs out" (https://antigravity.google/docs/cli/using/).
  It lives in the user's `settings.json`, which this adapter neither reads nor overrides.

Google's own words on print mode and on third-party access are quoted, with links and the date
they were read, in this route's row of `rlm_harness/community/README.md`. The use this adapter is
built for is print mode on your own machine, signed in with your own account, for your own use.

The `agy` executable is found on `PATH`, then at `~/.local/bin/agy`, which is where the official
install script puts it (`TARGET_DIR="$HOME/.local/bin"`; settle with
`curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | grep TARGET_DIR=`) and which is not on
`PATH` until `agy install` adds it. Pass `executable=` to choose another.

class AntigravityLM(dspy.LM):
    """A dspy LM whose completions run through the `agy` CLI on an Antigravity sign-in.

    Satisfies both rlm-harness seats: the planner arrives on the async engine, the sub-LM seat on
    the sync one from `llm_query[_batched]` worker threads, and both run the same `agy` call
    under one process-wide concurrency cap of 2. Works under `intercept_sub_lm` unchanged.

    `model` is an id `agy models` lists for your account, such as one of its Gemini variants; the
    list depends on the plan. The trace label becomes `agy/<model>`.

    **Google has not explicitly allowed this use**, so the route is `NOT_EXPLICIT` in
    `community.ROUTES` and the first instance built in a process logs a warning pointing at
    `rlm_harness/community/README.md`, which quotes what Google has said.

    **`n` costs calls.** dspy runs one engine call per candidate, so `n=k` is k `agy` processes
    against one account. The constructor warns above 1, as `ClaudeAgentLM`'s does.

    **`max_tokens` is carried and not applied.** `agy` has no output cap, so like `ClaudeAgentLM`
    this LM tolerates and ignores `max_tokens=`. `applied_lm_budget` still reports one passed here,
    and `completion_tokens` can exceed it; the `agy/` prefix on the model key is how a trace reader
    tells.

    **A connection kwarg is refused** (`api_key`, `base_url`, `timeout`, ...): dspy raises
    `ValueError` for one on an LM with a custom engine, because this LM talks to a local CLI, not
    an endpoint. `timeout_s=` is the call deadline: end to end, INCLUDING time queued behind the
    concurrency cap. On expiry `agy` and every process it started are killed (one `killpg` on
    POSIX, `taskkill /T` on Windows) and `TimeoutError` is raised.

    **What stops a running call.** Its deadline. For an awaited `acall`, leaving the await any way
    but its result: a cancelled task, `asyncio.wait_for`, a coroutine closed while it waits; a call
    cancelled while still queued for a slot never starts `agy`. NOT a loop that is closed with the
    call still pending, as a driver using `loop.run_until_complete` leaves it after Ctrl-C:
    nothing cancels the call, and the interpreter waits for its `agy` on exit (measured: 8.5 s
    for a fake `agy` that slept 8 s, Ctrl-C at 1 s). `asyncio.run` cancels it, so drive a run with
    that, as `RLMTask.run` does. For a sync call, any exception raised in the
    thread running it, a `KeyboardInterrupt` included. What does NOT stop one is Ctrl-C reaching
    `agy` itself: on POSIX `agy` runs in its own session so one signal can kill its whole group,
    and that keeps the terminal's SIGINT from it. So under `asyncio.run`, which is how
    `RLMTask.run` drives a run, the FIRST Ctrl-C cancels the planner's awaited call and kills its
    `agy`, but a sub-LM call does not see it: `llm_query` runs on the loop's thread inside the
    sandbox step, where `asyncio.run` only schedules a cancel, and `llm_query_batched` runs on
    worker threads. Such a call runs until it answers or meets its deadline. A second Ctrl-C
    raises `KeyboardInterrupt` on the main thread and kills a call running there.

    **The billing guard applies to every call.** `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `AGY_ADC_AUTH` can move `agy`
    onto an API key or a Google Cloud project, and nothing in a call's output says which account
    paid. Each call starts `agy` with both removed from the environment as it is at that moment,
    so one set after construction is removed too. `allow_api_key=True` passes them through.

    **Which failures end the task.** A deadline, a status other than `SUCCESS`, a turn cut short,
    a non-zero exit and a missing result event raise `TimeoutError` / `RuntimeError`. dspy wraps
    those as `LMUnexpectedError`, which it does not retry. On the PLANNER seat the kit's task retry
    treats that as fatal (`_dspy_compat.is_fast_fail_lm_error`), the same as `ClaudeAgentLM`:
    `agy` already did its own rate-limit retries, so another attempt resends a call it gave up on.
    On the SUB-LM seat dspy.RLM catches it instead and shows it to the model: `llm_query` raises
    it inside the sandbox code, and `llm_query_batched` returns it as an `"[ERROR] ..."` string.

    Bad model OUTPUT is NOT raised. An empty answer, or a schema call answered without a
    `structured_output`, comes back as an empty completion with a warning naming the
    conversation, which is what a litellm-backed LM returns for an empty message. On the planner
    seat an adapter rejects it as `AdapterParseError`, so the task retries it within
    `max_retries`; on the sub-LM seat the code receives `""`, from `llm_query_batched` too, where a
    raised error used to become `"[ERROR] ..."`. With `cache=True` (off by default) dspy caches
    that empty completion like any other, so a retry sending the identical request replays it
    rather than asking `agy` again, as it would for a litellm LM. Tests pin both halves.
